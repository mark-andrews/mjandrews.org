In this talk, I describe how we have used a custom R package,
[`psyntur`](https://mark-andrews.github.io/psyntur), to facilitate
teaching statistics using R in the Psychology Department at [Nottingham
Trent University](https://www.ntu.ac.uk/). I describe our initial
motivation for using a custom R package, our initial objectives for the
package, the general objections to using a custom package, our response
to these objections. Then, I will provide a brief overview of the
package, and some unexpected practical issues we faced when using it.

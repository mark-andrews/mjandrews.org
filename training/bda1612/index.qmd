A two day workshop introducing Bayesian data analysis using R. On the
first day, we provide a general introduction to Bayesian data analysis
and how it differs from the more familiar classical approaches to data
analysis. We will also provide a general introduction to R and RStudio.
On the second day, we will cover Bayesian linear and generalized linear regression using
the probabilistic programming language [Jags](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net).

In this 2hr course, we will provide an introduction to data analysis and statistics in Python. 
In particular, we will cover data processing using `pandas`, statistical analysis using `statsmodels`, and data visualization using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
In more detail, the `pandas` library provides means to represent and manipulate data frames.
We will introduce how to read data in Python using `pandas`, and perform some general data wrangling including selecting rows and columns by name and other criteria, applying functions to the selected data, aggregating the data, etc. 
We will also look at general data visualization. 
The `matplotlib` library is a low level plotting library that allows for considerable control of the plot, albeit at the price of a considerable amount of low level code. 
Based on `matplotlib`, and providing a much higher level interface to the plot, is the `seaborn` library. 
This allows us to produce complex data visualizations with a minimal amount of code. 
Finally, we will introduce how to to perform widely used statistical analysis in Python. Here we will
focus on `statsmodels`, which provides many of the mostly widely used statistical methods.

# Jupyter notebook

The Jupyter notebook for this course is [here](https://github.com/mark-andrews/intro2pystats/blob/master/notebooks/notebook.ipynb).
Usually, Jupyter notebooks render as a nice webpage in GitHub.
Sometimes, it does require a few reloads to get that.
But of course, you can always download it and use it in your Jupyter or upload it and use it on [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Use the notebook online with *mybinder*

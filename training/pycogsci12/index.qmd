The objective of this workshop is to introduce the Python programming
language for use in cognitive science research. Within the last 10
years, the development of scientific and numerical libraries in Python
has grown to the point where Python can now be used as a scientific and
numerical computing environment comparable to products like Matlab. The
aim of this tutorial is to describe these areas of
application and to advocate the advantages and appeals of using Python
as the principal programming language in cognitive science research.

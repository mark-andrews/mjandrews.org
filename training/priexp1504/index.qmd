A two day workshop introducing Bayesian data analysis. On the first
day, we provide a general introduction to Bayesian data analysis and
how it differs from the more familiar classical approaches to data
analysis. On the second day, we delve more deeply into the theoretical
and practical details of Bayesian inference, particularly focusing on
Bayesian linear models.

Bayesian methods are now increasingly widely in data analysis across most
scientific research fields.  Given that Bayesian methods differ conceptually
and theoretically from their classical statistical counterparts that are
traditionally taught in statistics courses, many researchers do not have
opportunities to learn the fundamentals of Bayesian methods, which makes using
Bayesian data analysis in practice more challenging. This seminar provides an
introduction to Bayesian methods, both theoretically and practically.  We will
overview the fundamental concepts of Bayesian inference and Bayesian modelling,
including how Bayesian methods differ from their classical statistics
counterparts, and show how to do Bayesian data analysis in practice in R.

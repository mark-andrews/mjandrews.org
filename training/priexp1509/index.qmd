title: 'Prior Exposure Bayesian Data Analysis Workshops: September, 2015'
date: September 22, 2015
description: |
  This two-day workshop covers advanced topics in Bayesian data analysis, including multilevel models and probabilistic mixture models. The first day focuses on multilevel linear and generalized linear models using the `MCMCglmm` R package and JAGS. The second day delves into probabilistic mixture models, nonlinear regression, and the theoretical basis of MCMC samplers, primarily using JAGS.

  A note on how to analyse text for themes and topics using local LLMs like Llama. 
  This note is divided into three parts.
  I cover how to install Ollama and use it in R, provide a worked example of qualitative text analysis using Llama, and then discuss the computational power requirements for using local LLMs for real-world analyses.
